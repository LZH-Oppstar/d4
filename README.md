# Day 4 - Signal Processing
Scenario: Finally, you're starting to validate the main feature of Dawnstar's FIR Filter IP: Signal processing.

## Assignment instructions
You only need to validate chip unit 0 today, represented by `impl0`. 

You are also given:
- 4 configuration files: `p0.cfg`, `p4.cfg`, `p7.cfg`, `p9.cfg`
- Vector to be filtered by the FIR filter, `square.vec`

Set the filter's coefficients based on the 4 configuration files and drive its input signal using the vector file containing the values of the input signals. 

## Submitting the assignment
- Click "Fork" (upper right, above "Add file" and "Code") 
- Create fork without changing any of the settings
- Go to signal-processing.py and modify it according to the instructions.

Note: You can refer to `using-github-and-autograder.pdf` in `/home/emmanuella.pv@oppstar.local/PYTHON_TRAINING/` after you connect to Remote Server `10.80.10.25`. Although the "Using Autograder" part is no longer applicable since we are no longer using GitHub Classroom, the "Using GitHub" part is still applicable.
